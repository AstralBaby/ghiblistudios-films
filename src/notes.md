# New films
- Thubmnails are uploaded locally and stored in base64
- Films are stored in localstorage to prevent data loose after state updates or reloads.

# Building the ui
- The first thing i did was create a layout with AdobeXD, i took inspiration from disney+ website and some dribble concepts.
- With the mockup done i started building the structure with react and tailwind
- 
- Once the mockup is fully completed i start building the layout structure in react.
